Procedure  #protocol

Binding Spell Procedures

To bind myself to my reality model, I will follow the steps below:

- Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit.

- Close my eyes and take a few deep breaths to relax and clear your mind.

- Bring my attention to my internal dialogue, or the thoughts and mental conversations that are constantly running through my mind.

- Notice any patterns or themes in my inner monologue that may be conflicting with my reality model.

- Use NLP techniques such as reframing or visualization to replace these negative or conflicting thoughts with more positive and empowering beliefs that align with my reality model. For example, I visualize myself as the embodiment of pure love and light. I am my highest self and Godhead.

- Use psychological anchors such as affirmations or mantras to help reinforce my beliefs. Repeat these affirmations and mantras to myself regularly, either out loud or silently in my mind.

- Use physical anchors such as gestures and facial expressions to help anchor my beliefs in my body. For example, when I  make a fist and hold it to your heart to symbolize the pure love and light within you. When I smile and make a peace sign I embody the peace and compassion of my highest self.

- Use mental anchors such as visualization and guided meditation to help bring my beliefs into my consciousness on a deeper level. I am the embodiment of pure love and light, and see myself radiating this energy out into the world.

- Use emotional anchors such as music or art to help my beliefs into my emotional body. Choose music and art that resonates with the energy of pure love and light, and allow myself to feel these emotions deeply.

By using a combination of NLP techniques, psychological anchors, physical anchors, mental anchors, and emotional anchors, I can effectively bind myself to my reality model and fully embody the energy of my highest self and Godhead.

Reminders #protocol

- Surround yourself with people who encourage you to think and act independently.

- Don't expect troubles to come your way, as they often disappoint.

- Many people have a tendency to allow negative influences from others to cloud their thinking. This can be damaging and difficult to correct.

- A state is a set of beliefs or identity that influences our experiences

  - Example: Marilyn Monroe was able to switch into a state that made people recognize her as a celebrity

- We can switch into different states at will and these states affect how we interact with others and how they interact with us

  - Example: A calm state may be more appropriate when working on projects, while a peak flow state may be more suitable when having fun or speaking publicly

- To enter into a desired state, we can use inner suggestion, such as the word "flow," or anchor the state through our physical appearance, mannerisms, and voice

- By becoming aware of and consciously entering into different states, we can perform better as artists, public speakers, and entrepreneurs

  - Example: A peak flow state can help us feel more confident and joyful while performing or speaking publicly

- These states can be called a peak flow or high bliss, or a calm flow or calm bliss state

- It is important to remain aware and integrated with our physical environment, emotions, and inner conversations while in these states

- We should maintain light-hearted observation without becoming overly identified with the experience

- This ability becomes automatic over time and allows us to remain in a desired state as long as we desire

  - Example: A calm flow state can be maintained while working on projects over an extended period of time

- This is extremely valuable for performing artists, public speakers, and entrepreneurs

- The first step to entering into a desired state is to acknowledge that we already have the ability to do so through inner suggestion and anchoring

- We may also find that we do not need to suggest the state anymore, but can simply feel back into it

- The best suggestion is made by those who have acquired the suggestive manner through the exercise of authoritative utterances and commands, physical appearance, mannerisms, and tone
