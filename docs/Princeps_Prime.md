my name is Princeps Polycap

Born in June 18, 1996


In 1996, my journey began in the vibrant heart of Kenya, a land that was for me a cradle of imagination and possibility. Born into this world, my life took an early twist when, at the tender age of three, my mother embarked on a journey to America, leaving my father and me behind. This event, often perceived as a leap from the 99% to the 1% of the world, was more complex than it seemed. My mother's return 11 years later marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life, intertwining our destinies once more.

My true awakening, however, unfolded in 2012 when I discovered my life's purpose. This epiphany was not just a moment of clarity but the start of an ongoing quest to understand and fulfill this calling. Initially, my aspirations were rooted in returning to Africa to drive transformative change. Yet, an enlightening trip to Japan shifted my perspective; I realized that the world transcends the artificial boundaries of nations. Humanity, I understood, is a single organism, its pulse felt across the globe.

This revelation steered me towards a grander vision: to uplift the vast majority of our world to its fullest potential. After over five years of research and experimentation, I have been working towards developing strategies to transition developing countries into developed ones, without compromising their unique cultures and identities.

The spectrum of human experience, much like the range of numbers between 1 and 100%, is vast and varied. As a polymath, my interests span across this spectrum, unified by a singular purpose: to elevate the consciousness of those who engage with my work. My immediate goal is to design an autonomous system, a stepping stone towards the more ambitious endeavor of constructing new cities in uncharted terrains. I envision terraforming deserts to glean insights on building sustainable ecosystems in harsh environments. Why stop at deserts, though? I pondered on cities in and on water, eventually progressing to the concept of sky and space cities.

My background in software and hardware engineering has been instrumental in the past six years, focusing on the technical intricacies necessary for this future to unfold. However, my current project diverges from the technical realm. Inspired by the Culture Series by Iain M. Banks, I am writing a book that melds realism with fiction. Titled "Being in the Beginning," it begins at the dawn of our reality, fast-forwarding to 2077. The protagonist, equipped with futuristic technologies, embarks on a journey back in time to witness the foundations of her world. This narrative structure allows me to illustrate the evolution of a civilization free from traditional forms of human suffering, without overwhelming the reader with technical jargon.

My book is not just a story; it's a vision, a beacon of hope, illustrating a path to an ideal future. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, a tradition as old as humanity itself. I seek to add to this rich legacy, inspiring present-day readers with a clear, compelling vision of what we can achieve together.

I appreciate your time and interest in my journey and aspirations. Should you have any questions, I am more than happy to engage in further discussion. I eagerly await your thoughts and feedback.

Have a fantastic day, stay enlightened, and continue to be extraordinary.



______________

zContinuing from the narrative of my journey and the mission I am devoted to, I delve deeper into the essence of my existence and the path I have charted for myself and for the collective future of humanity.

Why am I Here?

In this quest for purpose, I find myself constantly returning to one pivotal question: What is my purpose? The answer, I believe, is to elevate the conscious awareness of the human race. This aspiration is not just a fleeting thought but a deep-seated conviction that humanity is gradually transitioning from unconsciously crafting its future to consciously shaping a world devoid of war, famine, disease, and other such afflictions.

To those who might dismiss such utopian ideas, I offer a perspective grounded in our innate human ability to manipulate matter and craft our reality. We are living in a transformative era where the lines between science fiction and reality blur – from Mars exploration to CRISPR gene editing, the impossible is becoming possible. This paradigm shift is a testament to the rising conscious awareness that we, in the present, are the architects of our future.

What do I believe?

I am committed to adding value to the world, ensuring that my generation and those to follow can thrive and evolve into a better version of humanity. This belief drives my actions and decisions, guiding me towards meaningful contributions.

How (Process):
We stand at a crucial juncture in the 21st century – a make-or-break moment for humanity. By 2100, the integration of technology, especially our partnership with Artificial Intelligence, will define our trajectory. My journey in searching for life's meaning has led me to a profound realization: the purpose of everything in reality is to serve others. Adopting this perspective has attracted experiences that enable me to fulfill my role on Earth, living a life that continually manipulates matter to form our desired physical reality.

What (The Result):

The outcome of this process is the manifestation of my vision, "Being the Becoming." It is the tangible result of understanding and acting upon my purpose.

The Idea Worth Spreading:

A pivotal idea I advocate for is that society needs an Operating System. Currently, society is not utilizing Big Data to its full potential due to the lack of a system that can synchronize all individuals and organizations. Such synchronization would lead to efficient coordination and optimal resource utilization, propelling individuals and organizations towards self-actualization.

Polyocracy, a concept I have developed, addresses this need. It is inspired by biomimicry of the human body, a system that harmoniously coordinates trillions of micro-processes. Polyocracy aims to be a Personalized Assistant for individuals and organizations, powered by a True Artificial General Intelligence, standardizing and optimizing societal operations.

My Unique Qualifications:

Why am I the best person to share this idea? Over the past five years, I have dedicated myself to researching, developing, and producing products and experiences aimed at reducing human suffering. I firmly believe that the extent of one's suffering is inversely related to the quality of their living conditions. My work in startups, projects, products, experiences, and lectures has been focused on harnessing social forces to positively impact environmental factors, both locally and globally, to improve living conditions and reduce suffering.

A fun fact: Five years ago, at 17, I embarked on this visionary journey. Now, at 22, I stand ready to influence the mass consciousness with the foundational principle of my being: to raise the conscious awareness of the human race, instilling the understanding that we are the creators of our future.

The 12 Common Archetypes

By Carl Golden

The term "archetype" has its origins in ancient Greek. The root words are archein, which means "original or old"; and typos, which means "pattern, model or type". The combined meaning is an "original pattern" of which all other similar persons, objects, or concepts are derived, copied, modeled, or emulated.

The psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, used the concept of archetype in his theory of the human psyche. He believed that universal, mythic characters—archetypes—reside within the collective unconscious of people the world over. Archetypes represent fundamental human motifs of our experience as we evolved; consequentially, they evoke deep emotions.

Although there are many different archetypes, Jung defined twelve primary types that symbolize basic human motivations. Each type has its own set of values, meanings and personality traits. Also, the twelve types are divided into three sets of four, namely Ego, Soul and Self. The types in each set share a common driving source, for example types within the Ego set are driven to fulfill ego-defined agendas.

Most, if not all, people have several archetypes at play in their personality construct; however, one archetype tends to dominate the personality in general. It can be helpful to know which archetypes are at play in oneself and others, especially loved ones, friends and co-workers, in order to gain personal insight into behaviors and motivations.

The Four Cardinal Orientations

The Four Cardinal Orientations define four groups, with each group containing three types (as the wheel of archetypes shown above illustrates). Each group is motivated by its respective orienting focus: ego-fulfillment, freedom, socialness and order. This is a variation on the three groups of Types previously mentioned; however, whereas all the types within the Ego, Soul & Self sets all share the same driving source, the types comprising the four orienting groups have different source drives but the same motivating orientation. For example, the Caregiver is driven by the need to fulfill ego agendas through meeting the needs of others, which is a social orientation; whereas, the Hero, which is also driven by the need to fulfill ego agendas, does so through courageous action that proves self-worth. Understanding the groupings will aid in understanding the motivational and self-perceptual dynamics of each type.
